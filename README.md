The project aims to assist Pewlett_Hackard streamline its current data management methods by utilizing Structured Query Language (SQL). The performed analysis will help identify key aspects on their employee datasets such as the number of employees retraining in the next few years and retirement plans, additionally will serve as the baseline to strategies on the new employees retention campaigns.

The first part of the analysis helped answer the questions: 

 -- What's going on with the salaries?

To enhance the analysis we used the Quick Database Diagram Tools to understand and model the different data used for the analysis.
